implicit
  it follows the code, so for example, if 'a' is an int that is later converted to a double by assigning
  to a double variable then it will be converted to a new type. This will cause some data to be lost as 
  well. For example if a double is converted to an integer, numbers after the decimal will be lost.

explicit
  the user purposely converts a data type to the desired type. This is more a desired purpose for the code
  to work properly or to obtain the proper result.


One bug I fixed was in the Task2A, i had trouble using compounat assignments while still operating. so I 
put the operation in paranthesis while still adding and assigning the desposit. I figured this out be looking
back at task A2 and see what took precedence
